## What is an Object in Python?

In Python, everything is an object. This includes integers, strings, functions, and even modules. This section provides an overview of what constitutes an object in the Python programming language.

## Objects Everywhere: Variables, Functions, and More

Explore how variables, functions, and other elements in Python are treated as objects. Learn how this object-oriented approach simplifies code structure and enhances code readability.

## Mutable vs. Immutable Objects

Understand the distinction between mutable and immutable objects in Python. Explore how mutability affects object behavior and learn best practices for handling both types.

## Object References and Identity

Delve into the concepts of object references and identity. Understand how Python handles references to objects and how identity plays a crucial role in comparison operations.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Discover the basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Python. Learn about classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulationâ€”fundamental concepts that leverage Python's object-oriented nature.
