# :wrench: unittest :

In Python, unittest is a built-in testing framework that allows you to write test cases for your code.
The unittest module is part of the standard library, and it provides a set of tools for constructing and running tests.
Here's a basic example to get you started:

<img aline = "left" width = "700px" src ="https://github.com/Rayen-JN/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/135613265/7cfb53d7-2904-4c15-9fc1-b432a829fa37"/>

# *args **kwargs :
In Python, *args and **kwargs are used to allow a function to accept a variable number of arguments. They are often used when you want to create flexible functions that can handle different numbers of input parameters.

# *args :
The *args syntax allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments.
It collects these arguments into a tuple. Here's an example:

<img aline = "left" width = "600px" src ="https://github.com/Rayen-JN/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/135613265/f54adfe3-678d-4af1-8dcb-539c63b62376"/>

# **kwargs :
The **kwargs syntax allows a function to accept any number of keyword arguments.
It collects these arguments into a dictionary. Here's an example:

<img aline = "left" width = "600px" src = "https://github.com/Rayen-JN/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/135613265/591b5f67-a668-42b3-8024-a68889582a98"/>

# Using both *args and **kwargs :
<img aline = "left" width = "600px" src = "https://github.com/Rayen-JN/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/assets/135613265/8117d125-3ca8-4dee-9470-ef8d9baffb54"/>
