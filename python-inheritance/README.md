## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass/child) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass/parent). This promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.

## How to Use Inheritance in Python

Learn the syntax and mechanics of using inheritance in Python. Understand how to create subclasses, access superclass methods, and leverage the benefits of code reuse.

## Types of Inheritance

Explore the different types of inheritance supported by Python, including single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multilevel inheritance. Understand the advantages and potential pitfalls of each type.


## Method Overriding

Understand the concept of method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows for customization of behavior in the subclass.

## Example Code

Find practical examples of inheritance in Python. Walk through sample code to see how to structure classes, use inheritance, and override methods.
