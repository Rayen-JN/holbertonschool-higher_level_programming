## Python Classes

Learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. Understand how to create and use classes, define attributes and methods, and implement encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## :floppy_disk: Python Data Structures

Explore the various data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Learn when to use each data structure and how to perform common operations on them.

## :red_circle: Everything is Object in Python

Discover the object-oriented nature of Python. Understand how everything in Python, from simple data types to complex structures, is treated as an object, and explore the implications of this paradigm.

## Python Exceptions

Handle errors gracefully in Python by understanding and implementing exception handling. Learn about try-except blocks, raising exceptions, and creating custom exception classes.

## :interrobang: Python If-Else, Loops, and Functions

Master control flow structures in Python, including if-else statements and various types of loops. Dive into the world of functions, arguments, return values, and recursion.

## :arrow_right_hook: Importing Modules in Python

Understand how to organize your code by importing and using modules in Python. Explore the import statement, module structure, and the concept of namespaces.

## :bookmark_tabs: Python Inheritance

Delve into the concept of inheritance in Python. Learn how to create and use subclasses, override methods, and leverage the power of inheritance to build efficient and scalable code.

## :traffic_light: Python Input and Output

Explore methods for handling input and output in Python. Learn about reading and writing files, working with standard input and output, and formatting data for display.

## :wrench: Test-Driven Development in Python

Embrace the practice of test-driven development (TDD) in Python. Discover the benefits of writing tests before implementing code, and explore popular testing frameworks like `unittest` and `pytest`.
